## ðŸ”§ Demo Environment Setup Guide

### AWS Services Checklist
- [ ] Lambda functions are deployed and active
- [ ] S3 bucket has recent data (last 24 hours)
- [ ] Athena workgroup is configured

- [ ] IAM permissions allow demo user access

### Browser Setup
**Required Extensions**:
- AdBlock (disable for AWS console)
- Password manager (for quick login)
- Screen capture tool (for backup screenshots)

**Browser Tabs (Chrome recommended)**:
1. AWS Lambda Console
2. CloudWatch Logs
3. S3 Console
4. Athena Query Editor
5. CloudWatch Executive Dashboard
6. CloudWatch Technical Dashboard  
7. QuickSight Flight Tracking
8. QuickSight Performance Analytics
9. Backup materials folder (local)

### Network Requirements
- **Minimum bandwidth**: 10 Mbps upload for screen sharing
- **Latency**: <100ms to AWS regions
- **Reliability**: Wired connection preferred over WiFi
- **Backup**: Mobile hotspot for emergency connectivity

### Audio/Visual Setup
- **Microphone**: Tested and working with consistent levels
- **Camera**: HD webcam if video is required
- **Screen sharing**: Test beforehand with actual presentation software
- **Backup audio**: Headphone jack adapter if needed

## ðŸŽ¯ Fallback Strategies

### If Lambda is Unavailable
- **Option 1**: Use pre-recorded video of Lambda execution
- **Option 2**: Show CloudWatch metrics from previous successful runs
- **Option 3**: Demonstrate using saved screenshots with narration
- **Narrative**: "This shows yesterday's peak performance..."

### If Athena Queries Timeout
- **Option 1**: Use pre-executed query results (CSV files)
- **Option 2**: Show query history with successful executions
- **Option 3**: Import results into Excel for live manipulation
- **Narrative**: "Here are the results of the same query from this morning..."

### If Dashboards Won't Load
- **Option 1**: Use high-resolution dashboard screenshots
- **Option 2**: Switch to mobile-responsive view (often loads faster)
- **Option 3**: Use exported PDF versions of dashboards
- **Narrative**: "These dashboards normally update in real-time..."

### If Internet Connection Fails
- **Option 1**: Switch to offline backup materials immediately
- **Option 2**: Use pre-recorded video demo (full 8-minute version)
- **Option 3**: Continue with sample data outputs and static visuals
- **Narrative**: "Let me show you the same data using our backup materials..."

### If Screen Sharing Fails
- **Option 1**: Use USB backup drive with materials on local machine
- **Option 2**: Email key screenshots to participants in real-time
- **Option 3**: Describe components verbally while showing printed materials
- **Narrative**: "While we resolve this technical issue, let me walk you through what you would see..."

## ðŸ“± Mobile Demo Backup

### Smartphone/Tablet Approach
If primary demo fails, QuickSight mobile app provides:
- Real dashboard access on mobile devices
- Touch interaction demonstrations
- Offline capability showcase
- Quick recovery option

### Mobile Demo Script (2 minutes)
> "Let me show you the mobile experience our field teams use. This is the same data, optimized for tablets and phones..."

**Actions**:
1. Open QuickSight mobile app
2. Navigate to Flight Tracking dashboard
3. Demonstrate touch interactions (pinch, swipe, tap)
4. Show offline capabilities
5. Highlight responsive design adaptation

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Demo Verification Checklist

### 24 Hours Before
- [ ] Test complete demo script end-to-end
- [ ] Verify all AWS services are operational

### 2 Hours Before
- [ ] Re-run all demo queries to verify results
- [ ] Check dashboard refresh timestamps
- [ ] Verify network connectivity and speed
- [ ] Test screen sharing with presentation software
- [ ] Load all browser tabs and verify functionality

### 30 Minutes Before
- [ ] Clear browser cache and reload dashboards
- [ ] Check audio/video equipment

- [ ] Review backup material locations
- [ ] Practice smooth transitions between tabs

### 5 Minutes Before
- [ ] Close unnecessary applications
- [ ] Disable notifications and screen savers
- [ ] Verify presentation mode/screen resolution
- [ ] Have confidence that backup materials are ready
- [ ] Take deep breath and visualize success
