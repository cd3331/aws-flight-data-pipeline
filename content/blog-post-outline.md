## III. Implementation Journey: 7 Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
```yaml
Deliverables:
  - Terraform IaC setup
  - Multi-environment strategy
  - Basic S3 data lake
  - Initial Lambda functions

Key Decisions:
  - Region selection (us-east-1 for cost optimization)
  - Resource naming conventions
  - Security baseline (IAM, encryption)
```

**Code Example: Infrastructure as Code**
```hcl
# Terraform module structure
module "s3_data_lake" {
  source = "./modules/s3"
  
  environment = var.environment
  lifecycle_rules = {
    raw_data_expiration = 90
    processed_data_expiration = 365
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Data Ingestion Pipeline (Week 3-4)
```python
# Lambda function for data ingestion
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    try:
        # Fetch from OpenSky Network API
        flight_data = fetch_flight_data()
        
        # Store raw data with partitioning
        s3_key = f"year={year}/month={month}/day={day}/{timestamp}.json"
        store_raw_data(flight_data, s3_key)
        
        # Trigger processing pipeline
        publish_event("data.ingested", {"s3_key": s3_key})
        
        return success_response(len(flight_data))
    except Exception as e:

):
    # Implementation with caching and error handling
```

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Observability (Week 9-10)
