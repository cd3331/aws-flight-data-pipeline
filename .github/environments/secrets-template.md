PRODUCTION_APPROVAL_TEAM
  Description: GitHub team that can approve production deployments
  Value: @flightdata-pipeline/platform-team

## üìã Environment Variables

These variables are configured directly in the workflow files but can be customized:

### CI Pipeline Variables
```yaml
env:
  PYTHON_VERSION: '3.11'
  NODE_VERSION: '18'
  TERRAFORM_VERSION: '1.5.7'
  AWS_REGION: 'us-east-1'
```

### Deployment Pipeline Variables
```yaml
env:
  TERRAFORM_VERSION: '1.5.7'
  PYTHON_VERSION: '3.11'
  AWS_REGION: 'us-east-1'
```

## üîß Setting Up Secrets

### 1. Repository Secrets
Navigate to your repository on GitHub:
1. Go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`
2. Click `New repository secret`
3. Add each secret from the list above

### 2. Environment-Specific Secrets
For each environment (dev, staging, production):
1. Go to `Settings` > `Environments`
2. Create environment if it doesn't exist
3. Add environment-specific secrets
4. Configure protection rules (especially for production)

### 3. Environment Protection Rules

#### Development Environment
- No protection rules (automatic deployment)

#### Staging Environment
- Required reviewers: 1 person from development team
- Deployment branches: `main` branch only

#### Production Environment
- Required reviewers: 2 people from platform team
- Deployment branches: `main` branch only
- Wait timer: 5 minutes
- Prevent self-review

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Secret Rotation
```yaml
# Recommended rotation schedule:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/SECRET: Every 90 days
OPENSKY_API_PASSWORD: Every 180 days
DATABASE_PASSWORD: Every 90 days
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: When compromised
SONAR_TOKEN: Every 365 days
```

### Access Control
```yaml
# Principle of least privilege:
- Use separate AWS accounts for each environment
- Create dedicated IAM users/roles for CI/CD
- Limit secret access to specific branches/environments
- Enable secret scanning and dependency alerts
```

### Monitoring
```yaml
# Track secret usage:
- Monitor AWS CloudTrail for API key usage
- Set up alerts for unusual access patterns  
- Regular audit of secret access logs
- Automated detection of secrets in code
```

## üöÄ Deployment Configuration

### Branch Protection Rules
Configure these branch protection rules:

#### `main` branch:
- Require pull request reviews (2 reviewers)
- Require status checks (CI pipeline must pass)
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict pushes to admins only
- Include administrators in restrictions

#### `develop` branch:
- Require pull request reviews (1 reviewer)
- Require status checks (CI pipeline must pass)
- Allow force pushes by admins

### Workflow Permissions
Ensure workflows have appropriate permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read          # Read repository contents
  actions: read          # Read workflow status
  security-events: write # Upload security scan results
  pull-requests: write   # Comment on PRs
  issues: write         # Create issues for failures
  deployments: write    # Create deployment status
```

## üìû Emergency Access

### Emergency Deployment
For emergency deployments bypassing normal approval:

1. Use `workflow_dispatch` with `force_deploy: true`
2. Emergency access requires 2FA verification
3. All emergency deployments are logged and audited
4. Post-incident review required within 24 hours

### Secret Recovery
If secrets are compromised:

1. Immediately revoke compromised credentials
2. Update secrets in GitHub
3. Rotate all related credentials
4. Review access logs for unauthorized usage
5. Update incident response documentation

## üîç Validation Checklist

Before deploying, verify:

- [ ] All required secrets are configured
- [ ] AWS credentials have appropriate permissions
- [ ] Environment-specific secrets match target environment
- [ ] SSL certificates are valid and not expiring soon
- [ ] Notification channels are working
- [ ] Branch protection rules are properly configured
- [ ] Team members have appropriate access levels

## üìö Additional Resources

### AWS IAM Policies
The CI/CD user needs the following AWS permissions:
- Lambda: Create, update, invoke functions
- DynamoDB: Create, update, read tables
- S3: Create, read, write buckets
- IAM: Create, update roles (limited scope)
- CloudFormation: Full access to stack resources
- CloudWatch: Create, update alarms and log groups

### Terraform State Management
- State files are stored in S3 with versioning enabled
- DynamoDB table for state locking: `terraform-state-lock`
- Encryption at rest using AWS KMS
- Cross-region replication for disaster recovery

### Monitoring Integration
- CloudWatch alarms for deployment success/failure
- AWS Config rules for compliance monitoring
- CloudTrail logging for all API calls
- VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring

**Important**: Never commit secrets directly to the repository. Always use GitHub secrets or environment variables for sensitive information.
